## TASK 3 : Conditional rendering of content page (Route with normal content text) 

- Conditional rendering as the name suggests, works like if else conditionals. Using JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator, one can create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.
- To update UI, state and props also play a very important role. Props are passed via component properties, they're not reactive and State are variables that react will update the UI when values change.
- To show different content or navigate different pages, Changes in URL should be reflected. This can be achieved by using React Routers.

Acceptance Criteria : 
           
1. On clicking on the Home menu the Url should not change.
2. If no cities are selected then give information “You have not selected any city as a favorite yet.”
