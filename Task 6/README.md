## TASK 6 : Implement searching and selecting the cities


- To implement searching and selecting cities, we will use Fuzzy search and context API.

- A fuzzy search searches for text that matches a term closely instead of exactly. Fuzzy searches help you find relevant results even when the search terms are misspelled.

- Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree. Context is used to store the selected/unselected cities.

### Acceptance Criteria : 

1. On clicking the search bar we should be able to enter data.
2. On entering a letter the city having that letter should stay.
3. Then click on the city you want to add.
4. On clicking the add (+) icon in front of the city a message using React Toast (npm) of “City added” should appear in green.
5. City will appear in the left component
